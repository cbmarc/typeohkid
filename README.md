# Type Oh Kid

## Purpose
This project is a prove of concept to test electron. It uses electron and typescript. 

## Description
Type Oh Kid is a mini game for kids learning to read and at the same time, type on a keyboard. 

## How to run it
At the current stage the game can't be configured from ingame, because the current stage is just PoC. To configure the words you want tu use, edit the `resources/words.json` file and fill in whatever you want.

To run it just navigate in a terminal to the root of the project and run

`npm install`

and 

`npm start`

## Roadmap
If my son likes this game, I may make it more than a PoC, make it configurable by all and put in a series of kid-friendly words with pictures organised by language.

If this happens I may also consider packaging it for linux / mac / win. I may also add more animations to make it more rewarding.
